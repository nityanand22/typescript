## Typescript

- typescript is addon means it is nothing without js.
- typescript never runs,
- TS -> process -> js
- Type checker
- Consistency

## There is a file in typescript

- .d.ts => this is called declartion file.
- ye file node modules ke andar typescript package ke andar hota hai. ye file extension hai

- sometimes while installing any package we dont get the types of it. types means we dont get the suggestions, then we have to run the command to install the types => npm i -D @types/package-name

- If we dont get the then the typescript allows us to go to their git repo and there is some certain filer where we can write our own types.
